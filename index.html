    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the
      numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have
      accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns,
      just the total earned during that particular roll.</p>

    <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and
      losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that
      turn are added to his or her score.</p>

    <p>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.</p>

    <h3>Scoring Examples</h3>
    <p>Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig:</p>

    <p>Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue rolling. She rolls seven more times, getting a 6, 6, 6, 4, 5,
      6, and then 1. Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn is over and she earns 0 points for this turn.</p>

    <p>Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times, getting a 3, 4, 2,
      and 6. He decides to hold (and not take a chance of getting a 1). Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6 =
      21).</p>

    <h3>Alternative Versions</h3>
    <p>You can change the game of Pig a little by using two six-sided dice. In this version, if a player rolls and one
      of the dice is a 1, the turn ends and no points are scored (as in single-die Pig). However, if a player rolls 1s
      on both dice (snake eyes), that counts as 25 points.</p>

    <p>Other doubles are worth double points, so that rolling double 2s is worth 8 points, double 3s is worth 12 points,
      double 4s is worth 16 points, double 5s is worth 20 points, and double 6s is worth 24 points.</p>
